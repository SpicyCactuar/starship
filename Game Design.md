# Game Design

## Core Mechanics

- Game Loop
    - Move Spaceship and camera forward
    - Spawn Asteroids in the distance every 1 - 3 secs (random)
    - If player collides with asteroids, die (explosion?) -> Fail State
- Starship
    - Moves vertically and horizontally (small smooth rotations)
    - Constant speed forward
    - Explodes when hit by asteroid
    - Shoots when user presses spacebar (cooldown: 2 secs)
- Asteroids
    - Rotate permanently
    - Random model + size (0.9 - 1.1 scale)
- Particles
    - Explosion
    - Propulsion
    - Stars / Debris
- Background

## Extra

- Sound effects and maybe music (nice to have)
- UI -> Score / Time or something like that
- Restart Game
- Player wins if starship travels certain distance
- Different Backrounds
- Procedural Floor/Stage/etc.
