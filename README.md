Infinite 3D Asteroids-like game. The player controls a ship that infinitely moves forward dodging & shooting asteroids. The game ends when the ship is hit.

Final project for the [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics subject](https://campus.exactas.uba.ar/course/view.php?id=2433) of the University of Buenos Aires. The game is run by a minimal ad-hoc engine written in Javascript and leveraging WebGL.

## Features

* WebGL graphics pipeline:
  * Rasterizer
  * Directional lightning
  * .obj model renderer
* AABB collisions, visual representations of the boxes are shown
* Simple object pooling (stars)

## Build & Run

```python
python3 -m http.server
```

Access `localhost:8000`. Alternative hosting solutions should be equivalent. This is needed to access the game's assets locally.

Game is started automatically. Restart the tab to play again.
